# DOCKER COMPOSE PLAYGROUND

Here I will play with Docker Compose to try some ideas, stuff that I found around the Web, make some mistakes and learn from them.

So only use this Repository for recreational and educational purposes ;).

But feel free to make contributions and point me out mistakes and better ways of doing it.
